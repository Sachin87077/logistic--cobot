## üìå Introduction  

The **Logistic CoBot (LB)** is a collaborative robotics project developed for the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2024-25**.  
It is designed to simulate **autonomous warehouse operations** such as:  

- Transporting packages between zones  
- Navigating autonomously inside a warehouse  
- Picking and placing objects with a robotic arm  
- Docking and payload handling  
- Coordinating navigation and manipulation in real-time  

The project integrates **ROS2, Gazebo, MoveIt2, Nav2 stack, and UR5 manipulator** to replicate the environment of a real-world **Industry 4.0 warehouse automation system**.

## üéØ Objectives  

1. Develop a **modular CoBot system** capable of logistics tasks in simulation.  
2. Enable **autonomous navigation** in dynamic warehouse environments.  
3. Implement **motion planning and manipulation** using the UR5 robotic arm.  
4. Design **payload handling services** for attaching/detaching packages.  
5. Showcase a scalable **warehouse simulation** with collaborative robots.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture  

The system is built using ROS2 as the backbone, with multiple integrated packages:
